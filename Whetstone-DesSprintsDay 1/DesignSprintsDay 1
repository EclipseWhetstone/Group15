Features to add: 
An Adaptive Reminder System with Adjustable Encouragement
Jordan's concern will not be considered, since he would not need low maintenance
mode if he submitted assingments, but tailoring reminders to be adjusted to 
your procrastination habits is helpful for both the Canvagotchi and the user.

Evolving Pet
A dynamic pet evolution system allows user to feel as if their consistency is met
with reward, and at no expense to them.

Social System
Allowing friends to be added gives people a new lens to view the app. 
By letting friends see their progress, their consistency, their evolutions, 
it lets them engage with their friends academically, but also as a means of 
checking on those they hold close.
